Hello everyone,
I'm sharing with you my notes of exploitation [SweetRice](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40700).
I praticed this on this [Lab](https://tryhackme.com/room/lazyadmin)

#### How to open my notes
I saved my notes in .ctd extension, and opening it in plaintext is chaotic.
You need to have specialized note-taking software in order to open this properly.
One of many is [CherryTree](https://github.com/giuspen/cherrytree)
